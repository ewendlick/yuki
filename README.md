# yuki
A jQuery plugin to add animation events when you click. This has the dual purpose of helping me to learn how to use GitHub.

##Usage
Include the yuki.js file in your HTML file.
	<script src="yuki.js"></script>

Add the Yuki text decoration to a jQuery object.

    <div class="yuki"></div>
    <script>
        $('.yuki').yuki({shape: "diamond"});
    </script>
	
Click somewhere on the object.

Wait for UX/UI people to complain.
